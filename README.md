# XFoil-AutoIt
Using AutoIt to automate Airfoil Geometry Changes in XFoil

This was a fun project I did for an undergraduate aerodynamics course, last year.
While using an optimization algorithm/tool would be the right approach (I think) to do this project, my method used a scripting language, AutoIt, to interface with XFoil and automatically generate data for different airfoil shapes. 
The data, saved as a text file, were then imported into excel for processing and plotting to obtain the airfoil that met project requirements.
